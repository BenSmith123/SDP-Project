

TO DO
--------------------


- Map tweaks
- Skins
	- debug button or npc to change them
	- loading/saving current skin id
	- with weapon?
	- skins sold at a store?
	
	
- test each class when recieving weapons
	
	
- Mobile zoomed in gfx
- Keep an eye out for off screen spawining since transitions were added? FIX

- add mobs abilities!
- animate mob 4

- Make an easier map for noobs or fast level up or weaker mob?
- Mob hit graphics? (can tell when mob is stunned)


- large distant cloud background (i.e. behind mountain)
- Unbreaking projectiles - hit multiple mobs at once (by percentage) - skill or equip?
  ^ i.e. 10% unbreaking
- More helper NPCs - ones that tell you tips
- More items in shop
- Portrait mode?
- Configurable particle fx - epic mode?
- Weapon attack speeds? - slow/average/fast - based on equip
- Player can constantly walk/attack - maybe disable melee attack or disable movement if attacking
- shop: buy/sell items (seeker, revive potion lv.10, teleportation stone, key to unlock more maps?, full gamemaster controls)
Shop!
	- Revive potion
	- Seeker
	- projectiles
	- shield
	- full gamemaster controls
	- HUD change
	- Nametag change gfx?
	- Custom name?
- Game save - mob positions?
- Hidden maps - collision with obj will take them to map (outside of global map array)
- HUD colour/font hard to read
- ^ Better fonts?
- Stats!
- Grapple gun / teleport
- Graphics
	- Tilesets work
- Skill - spawn mob on your side
Content: Maps, Mobs, Items, NPCs, Shop items
- AI / Mobs:
	- Skills: Ground slam, spawn other mobs, area of effect, teleport?
	- Mobs walk back and forth when on one stretched out block - i.e. village map (might be mob_detect_wall script)
	- MOB movement - fix mobs sliding through walls? end of platform script works - might be conflicting
	- jumping mobs can walk through walls?
	- walking up slope changes to jump sprite - looks glitchy

- controls for when debug is disabled - escape is pause game, escape again to quit
- windows executable installer graphics!
- Discord logging
- ios app icon & splash screen


Tester1 & 2 feedback
	- replace stickman as player
	- max resolution (1920x1080?) - game looked tiny on his 4K screen
	- Equips, backpack


IDEAS
- Map builder?
- Starter pack
- Consistent game content - i.e. if boss killed don't re-spawn on new map
	- similar idea with loading/saving mobs - load file each map - check data/save on exit
- Healing stones? rather than progressively increasing stats
- Daily challenges

- Loading/saving mob positions
	- Save to file on room_end
	- Load file on room_start
	- Check age of file and whether or not to use?
	^ Will have to override mob spawner?
	
- Scrap the classes?
	- Have equipable weapons that anyone can use
	- Skills can be brought - teleportation stone
	- Auto melee attack if mob close instead of fire projectile?
