

TO DO
--------------------

- MVP
	- player damage as levels up? mob hp/damage etc
	- backgrounds!
	- more content! - maps, mobs, items, NPCs!


- AI:
	- jumping mobs can walk through walls?
	- walking up slope changes to jump sprite - looks glitchy
	- scripts still need more work - attacks with abilities don't always work
	  ^ improve AI behavior, chasing, randomness (stopping, jumping), visibility etc.
- UI for inventory items
- fullscreen/small screen option
- shop: buy/sell items (seeker, sell drone pieces, revive potion lv.10)
- Bank - store coins

- fix player getting stuck on slopes when knocked into
- Game save - mob positions?
- Debug for screen settings - game looks tiny on high res
- Text outline for HUD/damage text
- ^ Better fonts?
- Ladders / ropes!

- backgrounds & scenery! with depth
- projectile range & drop?
- gain extra exp when hitting a mob mid air? or player is in air - show on event log
- seeker to go pick up coins
- mob spawner? - create one where AI spawns (unless boss) set alarm random time that will continue to spawn
  ^ only spawn when AI that was there in room start has been destroyed
- fix player HP not being saved
- add better collision & bullet sprites & effects
- controls for when debug is disabled - escape is pause game, escape again to quit
- windows executable installer graphics!
