--------------------

- MVP
	- transitions between rooms
		- place markers on each side
		- determine previous level
		- set camera to not zoom toward player
	- fix walk through walls - place walls where needed
	- replace room blocks & remove block logic
	- AI better movement

- UI for inventory items
- fullscreen/small screen option
- shop: buy/sell items (seeker, sell drone pieces, revive potion lv.10)
- Bank - store coins
- AI spawner?
- fix player getting stuck on slopes when knocked into
- Game save - mob positions?
- Debug for screen settings - game looks tiny on high res
- Text outline for HUD/damage text
- ^ Better fonts?
- Ladders / ropes!
- Fix HUD healthbar sprite
- AI scripts still need more work - attacks with abilities don't always work
- ^ improve AI behavior, chasing, randomness (stopping, jumping), visibility etc.
- backgrounds & scenery! with depth
- refactor mob parent initialise/create event? - fix order
- projectile range & drop?
- gain extra exp when hitting a mob mid air? or player is in air - show on event log
- seeker to go pick up coins
- fix player HP not being saved
- add better collision & bullet sprites & effects
- fix cam? - lowest blocks should be at bottom of screen regardless of screen size or room height

refactor:
- clean up unused vars from player - mainly movement
- clean up /remove old scripts - get virtual joysticks fully working first
- menu links
- start healing only when standing still
