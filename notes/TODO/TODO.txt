--------------------

- MVP
	- player damage as levels up? mob hp/damage etc
	- more content! - maps, mobs, items, NPCs!
	
Tester1 & 2 feedback
	- replace stickman as player
	- max resolution (1920x1080?) - game looked tiny on his 4K screen
	- Equips, backpack



- Player can constantly walk/attack - maybe disable melee attack or disable movement if attacking
- fullscreen/small screen option
- shop: buy/sell items (seeker, sell drone pieces, revive potion lv.10)
- Game save - mob positions?
- Debug for screen settings - game looks tiny on high res
- Text outline for HUD/damage text
- HUD colour/font hard to read
- ^ Better fonts?
- Grapple gun / teleport

- Graphics
	- Drone operator destroyed
	- Tilesets work
	
- MOBILE:
	- jump down - press jump and hold down to jump down
	- inventory icon
	- interact with npc
	- debugging?
- AI:
	- MOB movement - fix mobs sliding through walls? end of platform script works - might be conflicting
	- jumping mobs can walk through walls?
	- walking up slope changes to jump sprite - looks glitchy
	  ^ improve AI behavior, chasing, randomness (stopping, jumping), visibility etc.
Android build
- Loading/saving mob positions
	- Save to file on room_end
	- Load file on room_start
	- Check age of file and whether or not to use?
	^ Will have to override mob spawner?
- put xcode app in project
- mob spawner? - create one where AI spawns (unless boss) set alarm random time that will continue to spawn
  ^ only spawn when AI that was there in room start has been destroyed
- fix player HP not being saved
- controls for when debug is disabled - escape is pause game, escape again to quit
- windows executable installer graphics!
- Discord logging
- ios app icon & splash screen

- Scrap the classes?
	- Have equipable weapons that anyone can use
	- Skills can be brought - teleportation stone
