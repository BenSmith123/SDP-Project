
TO DO
--------------------





 
------------ NEXT RELEASE ------------
- Map tweaks
	- test room - more test stuff?
	- make a beginners map with simple test bots and floors, more npcs
	- metal - needs a lot more
	
	
	- Make an easier map for noobs or fast level up or weaker mob?
	- Mob hit graphics? (can tell when mob is stunned)


--------------------------------------

- More skins!
- More mobs
- Another sword

- debug for spawning mobs?
- add plants
- shop sellable that isn't an item
- MiniMap

- HUD for test room to spawn random mobs?
- FIX player can constantly walk/attack - maybe disable melee attack or disable movement if attacking

- add mobs abilities!
- animate mob 4 - add more knockback?

- More helper NPCs - ones that tell you tips
- Portrait mode?
- skins sold at a store?

Shop!
	- Revive potion lv.10
	- Seeker
	- projectiles
	- shield
	- full gamemaster controls
	- HUD change
	- Nametag change gfx?
	- Custom name?
	- Expand inventory slot
	- key to unlock more maps?
	- full gamemaster controls
	
- HUD colour/font hard to read
- ^ Better fonts?

- Handle crashes: https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Debugging/exception_unhandled_handler.htm
- Stats!
- Skill - spawn mob on your side
CONTENT: Maps, Mobs, Items, NPCs, Shop items, SKINS
- AI / Mobs:
	- Skills: Ground slam, spawn other mobs, area of effect, teleport?
	- Mobs walk back and forth when on one stretched out block - i.e. village map (might be mob_detect_wall script)
	- MOB movement - fix mobs sliding through walls? end of platform script works - might be conflicting
	- jumping mobs can walk through walls?
	- walking up slope changes to jump sprite - looks glitchy
	
- controls for when debug is disabled - escape is pause game, escape again to quit
- windows executable installer graphics!
- Check out surface_depth_disable() for performance improvement
- Discord logging
- ios app icon & splash screen


IDEAS
- Unbreaking projectiles - hit multiple mobs at once (by percentage) - skill or equip?
  ^ i.e. 10% unbreaking
- Configurable particle fx - epic mode?
- Weapon attack speeds? - slow/average/fast - based on equip
- Hidden maps - collision with obj will take them to map (outside of global map array)
- warrior auto-defend skill - 50%chance of using shield when hit?
- ^^ need to find a sprite that looks like player is defending to avoid having to add more
- Grapple gun / teleport
- Meme button (move away from position when tapped)
- Map builder?
- Starter pack
- Consistent game content - i.e. if boss killed don't re-spawn on new map
	- similar idea with loading/saving mobs - load file each map - check data/save on exit
- Healing stones? rather than progressively increasing stats
- Daily challenges

- Loading/saving mob positions
	- Save to file on room_end
	- Load file on room_start
	- Check age of file and whether or not to use?
	^ Will have to override mob spawner?
	
- Scrap the classes?
	- Have equipable weapons that anyone can use
	- Skills can be brought - teleportation stone
	- Auto melee attack if mob close instead of fire projectile?
