

TO DO
--------------------

- fix positioning of HUD items
- AI scripts still need more work - attacks with abilities don't always work
- ^ improve AI behavior, chasing, randomness (stopping, jumping), visibility etc.
- finalise how blocks/tiles system work
	- can AI use them too?
	- room start script for setting all layers
- backgrounds & scenery! with depth
- refactor mob parent initialise/create event? - fix order
- projectile range & drop?
- gain extra exp when hitting a mob mid air? or player is in air - show on event log
- seeker to go pick up coins
- add inventory system + items?
- shop: buy/sell items (seeker, sell drone pieces)
- add better collision & bullet sprites & effects
- pause screen instead of blank background
- fix cam? - lowest blocks should be at bottom of screen regardless of screen size or room height

refactor:
- clean up unused vars from player - mainly movement
- clean up /remove old scripts - get virtual joysticks fully working first
- menu links
- start healing only when standing still


GOAL: Focus on fixing bugs & adding features, not just refactoring old code!
