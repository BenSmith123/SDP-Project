

TO DO
--------------------


MVP
- Mob spawns on your position
- ^ Make an easier map for noobs or fast level up or weaker mob?
- Sell sword for $1k but buy for $50?
- Weapon items dropped from mobs


- Equip projectiles working
- More items in shop
- New mobs
- More gfx



- Portrait mode

- Configurable partcile fx - epic mode?
- Player can constantly walk/attack - maybe disable melee attack or disable movement if attacking
- shop: buy/sell items (seeker, sell drone pieces, revive potion lv.10, teleportation stone, key to unlock more maps?, full gamemaster controls)
Shop!
	- Revive potion
	- Seeker
	- projectiles
	- shield
	- full gamemaster controls
	- HUD change
	- Nametag change gfx?
	- Custom name?
- Game save - mob positions?
- Hidden maps - collision with obj will take them to map (outside of global map array)
- Debug for screen settings - game looks tiny on high res
- Text outline for HUD/damage text
- HUD colour/font hard to read
- ^ Better fonts?
- Stats!
- Grapple gun / teleport
- Graphics
	- Tilesets work
- Skill - spawn mob on your side
Content: Maps, Mobs, Items, NPCs
- MOBILE:
	- jump down - press jump and hold down to jump down
	- inventory icon
- AI:
	- MOB movement - fix mobs sliding through walls? end of platform script works - might be conflicting
	- jumping mobs can walk through walls?
	- walking up slope changes to jump sprite - looks glitchy
- Loading/saving mob positions
	- Save to file on room_end
	- Load file on room_start
	- Check age of file and whether or not to use?
	^ Will have to override mob spawner?
- mob spawner? - create one where AI spawns (unless boss) set alarm random time that will continue to spawn
  ^ only spawn when AI that was there in room start has been destroyed
- controls for when debug is disabled - escape is pause game, escape again to quit
- windows executable installer graphics!
- Discord logging
- ios app icon & splash screen


Tester1 & 2 feedback
	- replace stickman as player
	- max resolution (1920x1080?) - game looked tiny on his 4K screen
	- Equips, backpack


IDEAS
- Scrap the classes?
	- Have equipable weapons that anyone can use
	- Skills can be brought - teleportation stone
	- Auto melee attack if mob close instead of fire projectile?
- Healing stones? rather than progressively increasing stats
- Daily challenges
- Starter pack
