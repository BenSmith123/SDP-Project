TO DO
--------------------

- mob item drops!
- room start script for setting all layers
- hud display for low health - similar to current hit
- backgrounds & scenery! with depth
- projectile range & drop
- seeker to go pick up coins
- improve AI behavior, chasing, randomness (stopping, jumping), visibility etc.
- ^^ cleanup unused vars & debug text
- add inventory system + items?
- shop: buy/sell items (seeker)
- add better collision & bullet sprites & effects
- pause screen instead of blank background
- fix cam? - lowest blocks should be at bottom of screen regardless of screen size or room height

refactor:
- clean up unused vars from player - mainly movement
- clean up /remove old scripts - get virtual joysticks fully working first
- menu links
- start healing only when standing still


GOAL: Focus on fixing bugs & adding features, not just refactoring old code!
