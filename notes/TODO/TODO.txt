--------------------

- MVP
	- player damage as levels up? mob hp/damage etc
	- backgrounds!
	- more content! - maps, mobs, items, NPCs!
	
	
Tester1:
	- More content
	- Fix melee
	- replace stickman as player
	- max resolution (1920x1080?) - game looked tiny on his 4K screen
	- Equips, backpack

- Mobile jump down - press jump and hold down to jump down
- Discord logging & release notes
- Player can constantly walk/attack - maybe disable melee attack or disable movement if attacking
- fullscreen/small screen option
- shop: buy/sell items (seeker, sell drone pieces, revive potion lv.10)
- Game save - mob positions?
- Debug for screen settings - game looks tiny on high res
- Text outline for HUD/damage text
- ^ Better fonts?
- Ladders / ropes!
- Grapple gun / teleport
- backgrounds & scenery! with depth
- MOBILE:
	- jump down?
	- inventory
	- interact with npc
	- debugging?
- AI:
	- jumping mobs can walk through walls?
	- walking up slope changes to jump sprite - looks glitchy
	  ^ improve AI behavior, chasing, randomness (stopping, jumping), visibility etc.
	  
Loading/saving mob positions
	- Save to file on room_end
	- Load file on room_start
	- Check age of file and whether or not to use?
	^ Will have to override mob spawner?
- mob spawner? - create one where AI spawns (unless boss) set alarm random time that will continue to spawn
  ^ only spawn when AI that was there in room start has been destroyed
- fix player HP not being saved
- add better collision & bullet sprites & effects
- controls for when debug is disabled - escape is pause game, escape again to quit
- windows executable installer graphics!
- ios app icon & splash screen
